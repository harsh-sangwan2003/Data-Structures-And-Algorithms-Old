Hello there. We'll quickly summarize the video, learn a couple new tricks and move on.
        
              RECAP:
        	        1. if-else statements are used to execute statements based on conditions. if the condition is true, if block gets executed otherwise  else block gets executed
        	        2. For more than two conditions, we can use nested if-else or "if, else-if, else" stack.
         	        3. In the "if, else-if, else" stack, block following the first truth is executed and rest is ignored. If all conditions are false, else block is executed
         
              FACTS:
         	        1.'=' is used to assign a value to a variable whereas '==' is used to check the value of a variable.
        	        2. To combine more than one condition in an if clause we can use logical operators - AND (&&), OR (||) and Not(!) e.g.
        	        	       
    to check if a number is a multiple of both 2 and 3 we can use && (true only if both conditions are true)
        	        	        	        if((num % 2 == 0) && (num % 3 == 0))
    
    to check if a number is multiple of either 2 or 3 or both we can use || (false only if both conditions are false)
        	        	        	        if((num % 2 == 0) || (num % 3 == 0))
    
    to negate a condition, we can use !
        	        	        	        if(!(num > 10)) is same as saying if (num <= 10)
    
        	        3.  If "ONLY ONE STATEMENT" is to be executed after the condition is true, there is no need create a block for the single line.  The following two yield same results.
   // Part1
         	        	        if(n%2==0)
         	         	        	        System.out.println("Number is even")
  
   // Part2
         	        	        if(n%2==0){
         	         	        	        System.out.println("Number is even")
         	        	        }
   
              EXERCISE:
                1. Meditate whether an if clause containing multiple conditions combined by && operator need to evaluate rest of the conditions if first conditions is false.
                2. Meditate whether an if clause containing multiple conditions combined by || operator need to evaluate rest of the conditions if first conditions is true.
               
              ADVICE:
                  1. Love yourself. 
        	          2. In case if you fail to focus and stay in the study, accept the past failure and forgive yourself. CLEAN THE SLATE.
        	          3. Cleaning the slate is the starting point for potential future progress.
